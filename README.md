# edge_of_stability
This project aims to recreate empirical results described in the paper Adaptive Gradient Methods at the Edge of Stability by Cohen et al. Edge of Stability (EoS) is a phenomenon observed particularly in Deep Learning where the stability (the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian) interacts with the training loss in surprising ways.
